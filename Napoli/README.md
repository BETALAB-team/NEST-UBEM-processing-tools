# Urban spatial energy analysis and clustering (Napoli example)

This directory holds sample files to run GIS-based statistical and spatial analyses to interpret how different urban features can affect the energy consumption in a city, and how urban environments can be clusterized to run early stage energy analyses and urban planning in the context of carbon reduction policies. In particular this methodology of the NEST UBEM processing tools provides a first shapefile of Napoli's census tracts already preprocessed, that can be used as an input file for the spatial analysis using [GWR4](https://gwr.maynoothuniversity.ie/gwr4-software/). 

The methodology consists in 3 major steps:

1. **Data collection and preprocessing**
   
   The first phase concerns the collection of data and preparation of the dataset, in this case run at the censu tract level. Following previous works on the topic,  a set of significant groups of variables was selected: environmental context, building stock characteristics, socio-economic condition, electric energy consumption. The results of this preprocessing is included in 

2. **GWR statistical and spatial analyses**
   
   This phase consists of running ..

3. **Clustering**
   
   This phase consists of running ..
